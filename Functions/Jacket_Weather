Q2: Jacket Weather?
Alfonso will only wear a jacket outside if it is below 60 degrees or it is raining.

Write a function that takes in the current temperature and a boolean value telling if it is raining. This function should return True if Alfonso will wear a jacket and False otherwise.

Try solving this problem using an if statement.

def wears_jacket_with_if(temp, raining):
    """
    >>> wears_jacket_with_if(90, False)
    False
    >>> wears_jacket_with_if(40, False)
    True
    >>> wears_jacket_with_if(100, True)
    True
    """
    if temp < 60 or raining:
        return True
    else:
        return False

#Alternate Solution
def wears_jacket_alt(temp, raining):
    return temp < 60 or raining

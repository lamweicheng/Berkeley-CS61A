Q3: Lambdas and Currying
Write a function lambda_curry2 that will curry any two argument function using lambdas.

Your solution to this problem should only be one line. You can try first writing a solution without the restriction, and then rewriting it into one line after.

If the syntax check isn't passing: Make sure you've removed the line containing "***YOUR CODE HERE***" so that it doesn't get treated as part of the function for the syntax check.

def lambda_curry2(func):
    """
    Returns a Curried version of a two-argument function FUNC.
    >>> from operator import add, mul, mod
    >>> curried_add = lambda_curry2(add)
    >>> add_three = curried_add(3)
    >>> add_three(5)
    8
    >>> curried_mul = lambda_curry2(mul)
    >>> mul_5 = curried_mul(5)
    >>> mul_5(42)
    210
    >>> lambda_curry2(mod)(123)(10)
    3
    """
    return lambda arg1: lambda arg2: func(arg1, arg2)

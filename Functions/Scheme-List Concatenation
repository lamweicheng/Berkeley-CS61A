List Concatenation
Write a function which takes two lists and concatenates them.

Notice that simply calling (cons a b) would not work because it will create a deep list. Do not call the builtin procedure append, since it does the same thing as list-concat should do.

(define (list-concat a b)
    (define (list-concat a b) (if (null? a) b (cons (car a) (list-concat (cdr a) b)))
)

(expect (list-concat '(1 2 3) '(2 3 4)) (1 2 3 2 3 4))
(expect (list-concat '(3) '(2 1 0)) (3 2 1 0))
